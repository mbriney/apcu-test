# Enable php73-apcu on Elastic Beanstalk

This configuration takes an existing PHP 7.3 running on 64bit Amazon Linux/2.9.1 and adds the necessary componets to the yum package manager to enable you to install apcu.  If you need additional modules that are not natively supported through the ebextensions packages this codebase could be useful.
